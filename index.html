    <p><h1>The end of the world</h1> It was a late spring evening. I was sitting in my room staring at a wall. My radio was playing in the background. I didn’t know that my life is about to change forever<h1>Who am I?</h1>I was a regular teenager.  I couldn’t find myself in my new school, new environment. I did everything I could to become noticed and accepted by others. It didn’t work. I had no one to talk to, I felt completely alone.<h1>What if…</h1>After a while the thought of the end of the world came back. „What if the world will really end, what if I have an accident and die? What will happen to me then?” Questions rushed through my mind. Fear  grabbed hold of me like never before and wouldn’t let go. It was the worst night of my life. Couldn’t sleep. After few hours I started to pray. I prayed for God to do something. To change my life. To give my life meaning and purpose. I was afraid of dying, but I was afraid of being lonely even more. I knew only God could help.<h1>The answer</h1>I didn’t expect God to answer my prayers so quickly. The next day a friend of mine invited me to a small prayer meeting. I started reading Bible again, met some great people. A few weeks later I went to a summer camp where I discovered that God can change my life, that he loves me for who I am and he accepts me. I gave my life to God and decided to have a relationship with him.<h1>Life with God</h1>Today my life is completely different. Because of my relationship with God I am a better man. I still have problems. Like everyone else I sometimes struggle. I face setbacks and defeats. But God gave my life meaning, a true purpose. He gave me a sense of self worth and took all my doubts away. Because of God I have a beautiful family, friends. And I know I’m never alone!
    If my struggles sound like something you’re experiencing, if you don’t know what will happen to you after death… if you feel lonely, not accepted or not loved… You should know that God loves you and he can make your life better. I encourage you to contact me if you have any questions or just want to talk. I’d love to hear your story!.</p>
